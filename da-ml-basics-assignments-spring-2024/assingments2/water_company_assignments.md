## Assignment 2: Apply CRISP-DM process for Water Company Data

Note! There is a lot of "artistic freedom" in this assignment, so don't think only about the points and try to come up with something new and creative from the data.

Note! A concise and focused answer is better than a long and broad one to this assignment.

### Add your information

# CRISP-DM process 

Assignments **2.1-2.2** you have an "imaginary project" where **you are consulting a water company**.
In this assignment, you will use the **CRISP-DM process model**.

* The data source is the water usage statistics published by the **Yorkshire Water** company for the years **2012â€“2015**
* The data source in the Assignment is from [https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/yorkshire-water-daily-customer-meter-data--local-area-](https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/yorkshire-water-daily-customer-meter-data--local-area-)

Note! You can use the Finnish-language [Yorkshire Water Jupyter Notebook document](jupyter_data/YorkshireWater_data_analysointi.ipynb) to analyze the results.
Or make your own data analysis document entirely if you have a lots of motivation to learn.

Below is some additional information about the data from its provider's website:

* A dataset showing daily water consumption readings in Cubic meters (m3) from internal and/or external meters in a discrete study in two distribution management areas (DMAs) in Yorkshire between 2013 and 2015.
* Data is taken from a live localized project investigating water use.
* Data has been anonymized to remove personal data and make its Data Protection Act compliant.
* The DMAs are also anonymized to prevent any open data activity affecting the results of the ongoing study the data has been taken from.


# Assignment 2.1: CRISP-DM: Business Understanding (max. 5p)

We are looking for answers, for example, to the following questions:
* What kind of data is involved?
* In what context can this data be useful?
* What kind of business is behind the data?
* What can be learned from data?
* What can be seen from the data?
* What can be identified from the data?
* Can something unusual be detected in the data?
* Is any other additional information needed in addition to this?

You can also tell us other considerations related to this assignment.

# Assignment 2.2: CRISP-DM: Data Understanding (max. 5p)

We are looking for answers, for example, to the following questions:
* What kind of columns are there in the data?
* What value has been used as a filler value?
* What kind of correlations can be found in the data?
* Review data at specific time intervals (e.g., week, month or year).
* Visualized data can be attached to support observations
* You can calculate basic statistics and summaries of the data
* Think about what can possibly be done with this data in the real project?

You can also tell us other considerations related to this assignment.

Note! Comprehensive data analysis is not required for full points. At this stage, the aim is to get an overall picture of 
the problem and dataset to be used for the future analysis phase and modeling phase.

The answer will be returned to the repository by the given return date:
* the return is made in MarkDown format (extension .md) or Jupyter Notebook (extension .ipynb) format.
* The images and figures are directly linked to the documents to be returned.

### Data processing

* See published [Yorkshire Water Jupyter Notebook document](jupyter_data/YorkshireWater_data_analysointi.ipynb). Note that this document is currently available only in _Finnish_.
* You can use this to help you understand the data in the dataset.
* It can also be supplemented to make additional observations and analysis (you can improve it yourself, implement new tool or use other tools to explore Data)

Note that the data also includes a [survey of consumer habits](jupyter_data/Yorkshire_Water_consumer_habits.csv). That should also be addressed in the assignments.
