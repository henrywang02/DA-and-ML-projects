## DA&ML Basics - Assignment 1: Create an EDA (max. points 10p)

In this **Assignment 1** you should create an **EDA** for given dataset (_data of football players_).

**EDA** (*Exploratory Data Analysis*) is an important initial step in data analysis and 
is performed before more complex modeling or statistical techniques.
EDA also involves examining and visualizing the data, and understand the characteristics of the dataset.

You can find dataset of the players from the *data* subdirectory:
[players.csv](data/players.csv).
Use this dataset in the Assignment 1.

### Add your information 

TODO: Add your name or names: 
* student_name = 'VUONG QUANG PHAT'
* student_id = 'AC4933'

## Description of assignment

Creatively perform EDA on the given data set and try to interpret the data set from different perspectives.
Remember that there is never a completely perfect answer to this kind of assignment, 
so that is, use your imagination and creativity and try different techniques.

## Jupyter Notebooks 

You must create Jupyter Notebook file based on this MarkDown document by yourself 
and finally return these assignments as **Jupyter Notebook** files.

Of course, you can program the solution to the tasks with just pure _Python_ (with libraries),
because it can be easier for code debugging,
but return format of this assignment should be in **Jupyter Notebook**.

The Python code cells in the Jupyter Notebook are run before the assignment is returned to the repository,
in which case, the results of the Notebook's **output** fields are printed directly when evaluating assignments in the repository.

## Sub-assignments 

Assignment 1 has **five** sub-assignments.

* 1.1: Statistics (2p)
* 1.2: Visualization (2p)
* 1.3: Grouping (2p)
* 1.4: Correlations (2p)
* 1.5: Modeling (2p)

## Evaluation 

Each assignment you can get **0-2** points with a simple table:

* **0** points: **Fail**
* **1** points: **OK** 
* **2** points: **Good** 

Note! The points given for each sub-assignment can also be **0.5** or **1.5**.

## Assignment 1.1: Statistics (max. 2p)

Possible parts in this assignment are:

* Load the sample data into a DataFrame
* Print info and summary rows
* Print data types of the dataset
* Calculate different statistics for the data
* Calculate summary statistics

## Assignment 1.2: Visualization (max. 2p)

Possible parts in this assignment are:

* Histograms
* Bar plots
* Scatter plots
* Any other suitable figure type etc.

Note! Visualization for only a subset of the data often makes sense to keep the graphs understandable.

## Assignment 1.3: Grouping (max. 2p)

Possible parts in this assignment are:

* Group the data by player's position and calculate the average performance metrics
* Are there other grouping possibilities in the data?
* Visualize results of grouping


## Assignment 1.4: Correlations (max. 2p)

Possible parts in this assignment are:

* Compute correlation matrix
* Calculate lower and upper limits for each numeric column
* Calculate the 5th and 95th percentiles for the features
* How to indentify potential outliers in the data?
* Visualize Correlations results to understand the relationships between features


## Assignment 1.5: Modeling (max. 2p)

Possible parts in this assignment are:

* Create a model
* Train the model on the training data
* Make predictions that are based on the testing data
* Calculate errors, accuracy, precision, F1-score etc.
* Visualize results

Justify why you want to classify with classification method or predict a certain feature with regression method.
