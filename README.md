### Data Analytics and Machine Learning Project Overview
During my studies at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, I had the opportunity to work on a Data Analytics and Machine Learning project as part of my coursework. This project focused on leveraging Python for analyzing datasets, building predictive models, and extracting meaningful insights.

Through this project, I learned to:

- Preprocess and clean real-world datasets.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.
- Develop and evaluate machine learning models using libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy.
- Visualize data effectively using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

This hands-on experience helped me build a solid foundation in data manipulation, model development, and result interpretation, further sparking my interest in applying these skills to solve real-world problems.
